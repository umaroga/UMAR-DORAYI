<h2>Geothermal and Alternative Energy Drilling</h2>

<p>As the economic climate continues to make trading conditions and finances challenging, there has never been a better time to look at alternative ways to supplement your energy supplies with a more efficient, green alternative.
Wind power</p>

<p>The UK has more usable wind power than any other European country. Wind turbines convert kinetic energy from wind into mechanical energy, which is then used to power a generator that converts energy into electricity. Utilising this free energy source not only helps the environment but also saves you money.</p>

<h3>Solar Power</h3>

<p>Solar photovoltaic systems are reliable, attractive and affordable making them a viable option to help reduce your energy bills by harnessing the energy of the sun. Investing in solar power means you are protected from future energy price increases, your carbon footprint is reduced and it is reliable, practical and maintenance free.</p>

<h4>Ground source water pumps</h4>

<p>Solar pumps offer a clean and simple alternative to fuel-burning engines and generators for domestic water, livestock and irrigation. They are most effective during dry and sunny seasons and require no fuel deliveriesâ€”a very efficient, economical and low-maintenance option.</p>
