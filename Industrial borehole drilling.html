The benefit of a borehole for industry

<ul type = "a">
<li>It will save you money long-term. In fact, in excess of 90% of your water bill can be saved, since a borehole abstraction below 20,000 litres per day is exempt from licensing and is essentially free.</li>
<li>Any business currently spending Â£750 per quarter or above would get a payback for their investment within two to three years.</li>
<li>Sometimes industrial sites suffer from variable water pressure and water quality which can result in an inadequate water supply to your premises. A borehole will prevent this.</li>
<li>Even in a dry season a borehole will continue to supply at a constant flow and pressure.</li>
    Borehole water is independent of water supplied by water authorities.
    Water restrictions such as a hosepipe ban do not apply.
    Boreholes are not affected by mains-system problems such as leaks.
