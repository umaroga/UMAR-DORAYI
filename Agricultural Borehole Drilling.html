The benefit of a borehole for agriculture

<ul type = "a">
 <li>It will save you money long-term. In fact, in excess of 90% of your water bill can be saved, since a borehole abstraction below 20,000 litres per day is exempt from licensing and is essentially free</li>
 <li>Any business currently spending Â£750 per quarter or above would get a payback for their investment within two to three years.</li>
 <li>Many farms suffer from poor water pressure and poor water quality which can result in an inadequate water supply to livestock and properties. A borehole will prevent this.</li>
 <li>Even in a dry season a borehole will continue to supply at a constant flow and pressure</li>
 <li>Borehole water is independent of water supplied by water authorities.</li>
    Water restrictions such as a hosepipe ban do not apply.
    Boreholes are not affected by mains-system problems such as leaks.
