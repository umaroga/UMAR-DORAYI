We have been drilling boreholes for domestic purposes for over 30 years. Whether you need a borehole to supply water to your house, irrigate your land or fill your pond or lake, we can build a drilling package to suit your needs.

Domestic applications also include golf courses, leisure centres, caravan parks and hotels.
The benefit of a borehole for domestic purposes

<ul type = "a">
<li> It will save you money long-term. In fact, in excess of 90% of your water bill can be saved, since a borehole abstraction below 20,000 litres per day is exempt from licensing and is essentially free.</li>
<li>Many properties on a spring water supply suffer from poor water pressure and poor water quality which can result in an inadequate water supply to your premises. A borehole will prevent this.</li>
<li>Even in a dry season a borehole will continue to supply at a constant flow and pressure.</li>
<li>Borehole water is a naturally-sourced and is independent of water supplied by water authorities.</li>
    Water restrictions such as a hosepipe ban do not apply.
<li>Boreholes are not affected by mains-system problems such as leaks</li>
